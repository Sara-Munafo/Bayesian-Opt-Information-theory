Welcome to the Bayesian Optimization repository! This project focuses on implementing the Bayesian Optimization method for fine-tuning hyperparameters. It is developed as part of the coursework for the Information Theory and Inference module of the Master's degree program in Physics of Data at the University of Padua.

## About

This study delves into utilizing Bayesian optimization to enhance the performance of one-dimensional and two-dimensional functions with known analytical expressions. Our methodology involves implementing acquisition functions such as expected improvement and probability of improvement, along with maximum likelihood estimates and sequential Monte Carlo algorithms, to refine the kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to improve a basic image classification algorithm in machine learning.

## Getting Started
- BYO_final.ipynb: jupyter notebook with the whole implementation;
- BYO_library.py: library of the functions we used in the notebook.
